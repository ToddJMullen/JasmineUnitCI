## Spec file extensions
- Commonly named like ***.spec.js** or ***.test.js**
- Specs are just tests to be run on the code
- Specs could be Typescript also
- The spec file names are based on the target file name e.g. **calculator.spec.js**
- 

## Suites
- Suites are a group of tests / specs 
- Gives us a way to organize the tests
