#Jasmine

## Spec file extensions
- Commonly named like ***.spec.js** or ***.test.js**
- Specs are just tests to be run on the code
- Specs could be Typescript also
- The spec file names are based on the target file name e.g. **calculator.spec.js**
- Spec => Specifications
- Specification are like expectations as in a list of things that we expect
- Expectations are statements whih are assertions e.g. 5 + 5 = 10
- Assertions can be true or false e.g. 5+5 = 10 -vs- 5+5 = 9
- If you have a spec with all passing expectations, then it is a passing spec.
- If one or more expectations fails, then the entire spec fails

## Suites
- Suites are a group of tests / specs 
- Gives us a way to organize the tests

## Expectations
